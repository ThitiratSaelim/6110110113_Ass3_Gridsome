Kim Shin becomes Dokkaebi (Goblin), possessing an immortal life. At first he thinks that he is blessed, but he realizes that he is cursed.</p>\n<p class=\"text-normal font-serif py-2\">Closer to the present day, Kim Shin has waited 900 years for a human bride to end his immortal life. One night, he saves a dying pregnant woman (Park Hee-Von) who is destined to die. Meanwhile, the Grim Reaper (Lee Dong-Wook) is unable to find the dead pregnant woman. The woman gives birth to a baby girl named Ji Eun-Tak (later played by Kim Go-Eun). 9 years later, Ji Eun-Tak lives with her mother and is able to see ghosts. One night, her mother suddenly dies. On that night, she meets the Grim Reaper.</p>\n<p class=\"text-normal font-serif py-2\">In the present day, Ji Eun-Tak is a high school student. She still sees ghosts and hears their whisper of “Dokkaebi’s bride.” She now lives with her aunt’s family, but she is mistreated by them. On her birthday, Ji Eun-Tak sits by the sea with a lighted birthday cake. At that time, Kim Shin suddenly appears in front of her. Kim Shin does not know why, but he can hear her voice and appears in front of her against his will. Coincidentally, Kim Shin lives with the Grim Reaper at the same house.</p>\n<p class=\"text-normal font-serif py-2\">Now, Kim Shin appears in front of her against his will, whenever she turns off the lights. One day, Ji Eun-Tak tells him that he is Dokkaebi and she is his bride.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"cast-and-characters\"><a href=\"#cast-and-characters\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Cast and characters</h2>\n<ul class=\"list-disc ml-5\">\n<li>\n<p class=\"text-normal font-serif py-2\"><strong>Gong Yoo</strong> as Goblin / Kim Shin </p>\n<p class=\"text-normal font-serif py-2\">  A 939-year-old immortal goblin and protector of souls who is in search for his bride, the only one who can remove the sword piercing through his chest. Once the sword is removed, he may finally move to the afterlife and rest in peace. He served as a General during the Goryeo era, where he was appointed as the regent with his sister being betrothed to the young king Wang Yeo. However due to corruption by a eunuch, the king's guards killed Kim Shin's sister, soldiers, and household before ultimately killing him with the very sword that is lodged in his chest. As punishment for his countless murders he committed during his time as a general, the Almighty God decides to resurrect him and give him supernatural powers and immortality. As he has lived for centuries, he feels lonely and depressed as he has to watch his loved ones and those around him pass away. This is until he slowly falls in love with his bride who gives him a reason to live again.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"text-normal font-serif py-2\"><strong>Kim Go-eun</strong> as Ji Eun-tak</p>\n<p class=\"text-normal font-serif py-2\">  An optimistic and bubbly 19-year old high school student and the legendary Goblin's bride. A \"Missing Soul\", she can see ghosts and summon the Goblin due to her way of birth; her pregnant mom was in a hit-and-run at the time to which the Goblin intervened to save them both, before the Grim Reaper could take them. Orphaned at age 9 and pursued by the Grim Reaper, she was forced to live with her abusive aunt who was seeking her mother's insurance policy. She immediately becomes interested in the Goblin, who takes her in his home so she can pass her exams and enroll in university, while he begins to rediscover the joy of living through her. Originally oblivious to her duty of removing the sword from the Goblin's chest, she eventually learns the truth and struggles with the decision of fulfilling her duty as she has fallen in love with the Goblin.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"text-normal font-serif py-2\"><strong>Lee Dong-wook</strong> as Grim Reaper / Wang Yeo / Lee Hyuk / Kim Woo-bin </p>\n<p class=\"text-normal font-serif py-2\">  A good-looking, cynical yet humorous grim reaper (Angel of Death) who guides souls to their reincarnations or afterlives and Kim Shin's housemate. Along with many other grim reapers, he became a grim reaper after committing the greatest sin of all in his past life. He has no memory of his past lives, but does possess supernatural powers. Originally preferring to be by himself, he falls in love with a chicken restaurant owner named Sunny who eventually reciprocates his feelings. Through her, he begins to unlock clues to his past memories and who he was in the past. His past life was revealed to be the young king: Wang Yeo. Despite the king's original pleasant personality, he became corrupted by the power hungry eunuch and orders his guards to kill everyone including his own wife and his loyal general, Kim Shin. This act drove Wang Yeo insane and caused him to ultimately take his own life.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"text-normal font-serif py-2\"><strong>Yoo In-na</strong> as Sunny / Kim Sun</p>\n<p class=\"text-normal font-serif py-2\">  The attractive owner of a chicken restaurant who hires Ji Eun-tak. The Grim Reaper begins to fall in love with her, and she soon returns his affection, although she is constantly confused by the Grim Reaper's constant social awkwardness. In her past life, it is revealed that she was the younger sister of General Kim Shin and she became the queen upon marrying King Wang Yeo (now the Grim Reaper).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"text-normal font-serif py-2\"><strong>Yook Sung-jae</strong> as Yoo Deok-hwa</p>\n<p class=\"text-normal font-serif py-2\">  A rebellious yet kind-hearted chaebol heir and the only grandson of the Yoo family, a household that has the responsibility of taking care of the Goblin. He originally is a spoiled young adult who was only looking after the Goblin in order to receive a new credit card (after he was cut off). However, he learns of the Goblin and the Grim Reaper's true identities, and the trio grew to become strong friends. It is later revealed that the Almighty God had taken over his body for a period of time so that he could enact his plan of intertwining the lives of Kim Shin, Ji Eun-tak, The Grim Reaper, and Sunny</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n","humanTime":"28 June 2019","datetime":"Fri Jun 28 2019 12:00:00 UTC+00:00","tags":[{"id":"tag5","title":"tag5","path":"/tags/tag5/"},{"id":"tag6","title":"tag6","path":"/tags/tag6/"}],"category":{"id":"Fantasy, Romance, Drama","title":"Fantasy, Romance, Drama","path":"/category/fantasy-romance-drama/","belongsTo":{"totalCount":1,"edges":[{"node":{"title":"Goblin","path":"/blog/goblin/"}}]}},"author":[{"id":"author3","name":"tvN","bio":"A South Korean nationwide pay television network owned by the E&M Division of CJ E&M.","image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/png","src":"/6110110113_Ass3_Gridsome/assets/static/tvN.77287e6.5fdb79529105ae14979db2b05d9a03a1.png","size":{"width":820,"height":365},"sizes":"(max-width: 820px) 100vw, 820px","srcset":["/6110110113_Ass3_Gridsome/assets/static/tvN.1b91758.5fdb79529105ae14979db2b05d9a03a1.png 480w","/6110110113_Ass3_Gridsome/assets/static/tvN.77287e6.5fdb79529105ae14979db2b05d9a03a1.png 820w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 820 365' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-9d31fd5f0fe6e9e13f56826548684048'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-9d31fd5f0fe6e9e13f56826548684048)' width='820' height='365' xlink:href='data:image/png%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAcAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGwAAAwACAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAABgcIAAQCAwX/xAA2EAACAQMCBAIGCAcAAAAAAAABAgMEBREABgcSITFRYQgTIkFxgRQVI2KRobLRMjNCc4KSwf/EABkBAAMBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMEBQYAAf/EAC4RAAEDAgQBCwUAAAAAAAAAAAECAwQAEQUSITEGExQjMkFRcZGhsdFhgcHC8P/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8Ap3OhW97zoqLclu2/RFaq7Vcyo8an2YE7sznx5QSF/HGl7xArOI9nF2un1lFS2VJSIkR4iyozcqgeznPUeeltw8t25bruCWr2xKouVOhlaeV16c3sk5YHJOTqc9NUFhtKTf8AH0raYbww05HXLfeQUgaWOgVbTMbaWJFwL/Na5Gs1NVfxA3xtvcoob5cmdqWVDPD6uMq69CQCF7EHuNPPd%2b6KWwbSnvQZZFaMGmXP813HsD/p8gdHalocCjtl3vUidw/JhqaTcL5XqlJJB27wO%2biLOkZvXjBebPuq5262U1tkpKWUxI8sbsxIAByQwHfPu1w4Wbr3duK9T1Nyu8ps1ujaoqsRRgNgEhMhffgn4A6TlXJPcrhVVPIzyys878ozjJLE6RlTSptJauL1qsB4YbZlutzsq8oG17AnxA1sPI1XWzNwx7h2lRXh%2bRDJETOq9kdchwM%2b7p08iNKra/FvcN%2b3ZQWuKktiwVNSI%2bYRPzCPPU/x9%2bUeGhnh5u76q2Ju21yycrNTmWmyf6nxGwH%2byn5HXb6Plu%2bl76aqK5WipnkB8GbCD9R13OlulpKTvvXgwGPAbnPPoBCepfs0uPcD7Ud%2bkbcfo%2b1aCgU4aqqedh4qi/uw1r%2bjbbvVWO7XFlw086wqT4IuT%2bbflrW49USV98tcczyBIqZioUjuXOfd5DR3wkoYaDYNtjg5sMZJGLdyS5/YaKkZ5pJ7B/e9IvrEbhpDad3Fa%2bZP6ilr6SFk9VX229xL7MyGmmP3l6qfmCR/jpcXfclxv9nsVlcM0VAhhiRSSZGLYBx4gYUfDz1SXFm3QXLYdxjqQcR8kqFe6sGHX8CR89Kng9tqgbe0E0oklamieeMORgOMAHt7s5%2bOl5TJ5xlSbBVqs4BiTYwjl3k5lMZreWnobUXXO0psHgncKXoK6oiCzuO7SykKRn7q5A%2bHnoC4BWWK7bluL1aB6aKieNx/c9j9PNpmcdYRVbXoqdndI3qwW5COuEbGtTgHbKegtd3kh5y8k6KxYg9ApIHbzOjKbBlIQNkiprExaMCkSlHpHVanxIHzap/3Da5bJfK621GfWUszRE%2bIB6H5jB07/Rst3qrNd7iy9Z51gU%2bSDJ/NhryeN1ho5t4R1X2iSz0yNJyEAMQSoPbwA/DTJ4RUUVBsK3xQc2GaR2LdyS5/YaFEYySiO69P8Q4qZOBNrtq5lv7n1Ff/2Q==' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"path":"/author/tv-n/"}]},"previous":{"title":"Hotel del Luna","excerpt":"The peculiar Hotel del Luna has existed for several millennia catering to lost souls.
